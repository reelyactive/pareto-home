      <h2>What does it do?</h2>
      <p>The included sensor listens for nearby Bluetooth Low Energy devices and streams their wireless packets to the Pareto cloud service.</p>
      <p>In other words, the kit detects and identifies wireless devices such as smartphones, wearables and electronic appliances that are present in your space.</p>
